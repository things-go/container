// Store is a generic object storage and processing interface.  A
// Store holds a map from string keys to accumulators, and has
// operations to add, update, and delete a given object to/from the
// accumulator currently associated with a given key.  A Store also
// knows how to extract the key from a given object, so many operations
// are given only the object.
//
// In the simplest Store implementations each accumulator is simply
// the last given object, or empty after Delete, and thus the Store's
// behavior is simple storage.
//
// Reflector knows how to watch a server and update a Store.  This
// package provides a variety of implementations of Store.
